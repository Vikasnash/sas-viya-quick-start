# Top 5 Things to Know for Using SAS Visual Analytics

### [Summary](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Top-5-Things-you-need-to-know-for-using-SAS-Visual-Analytics/ta-p/855258)
There you have it, the Top 5 things to know for using SAS Visual Analytics.

1. **Select Data, Pick an Object, & Assign Roles**  
   Begin by selecting your dataset, choosing a visualization object (e.g., bar chart, pie chart), and assigning roles like category or measure. SAS Visual Analytics can also auto-chart based on the data you drag onto the canvas.

2. **Report Prompts & Page Prompts**  
   Use prompts to filter data dynamically. Report prompts apply across the entire report, while page prompts affect only the current page, allowing for more targeted filtering.

3. **Actions: Automatic & Manual**  
   Set up interactions between report elements. Automatic actions like brushing highlight related data, while manual actions allow for customized linking and filtering.

4. **Multiple Data Sources**  
   Integrate and analyze data from various sources within a single report. Use joins or linking techniques to relate different datasets effectively.

5. **Create New Data Items**  
   Enhance your reports by creating calculated fields, aggregated measures, or custom categories directly within SAS Visual Analytics.

### Installation

1.	Visit https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-viya-quick-start and click **Code** > **Download ZIP**. 
2.	Unzip the files to your local machine. By default, the files will be in a folder named **sas-viya-quick-start-main**.
3.	In SAS Viya, select the Applications menu in the upper left corner and select **Develop Code and Flows**. SAS Studio launches. 
4.	In the Navigation pane on the left, select the **Explorer** icon. 
5.	Expand ![image](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-viya-quick-start/assets/22669486/d8c5b592-25ba-4b81-9e9e-795cb5efcee2). Navigate to your preferred location for storing the files. You must have write access. Right-click on the desired folder and select **New folder**. Name the folder **quick-start**.  
NOTE: Your environment may have a different label other than **Files**, but the icon will look the same. The file location demonstrated in the video is **Files** > **data** > **quick-start**.
6.	Select the new **quick-start** folder and click the **Upload** button. 
7.	Click **Add**, then navigate to the files you unzipped on your local machine. Press **Ctrl+A** to select all the files, then click **Open** > **Upload**.
8.	In the Explorer, expand the **quick-start** folder and double-click the **Load_Quick_Start_Data.sas** program to open it. 
9.	Do not make any changes to the code. Click **Run**. Confirm the **HOME_EQUITY** and **CUSTOMER_COMMENTS** tables are listed in the Table Information report.  
NOTE: As you follow along in your environment, the **HOME_EQUITY** and **CUSTOMER_COMMENTS** tables will be in the **Casuser** caslib.
